## Introduction

Offensive Python programming focuses on writing scripts and tools that can be used in a penetration testing or red team environment. The repository contains examples of code designed to automate tasks such as information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. While the content is intended for educational purposes, it is important to use these skills responsibly.

## Tools and Scripts

In this directory, you will find Python scripts for:

- **Network Scanning**: Tools to identify open ports, active devices, and vulnerabilities within a network.
- **Exploit Development**: Examples of Python scripts that demonstrate how to exploit common vulnerabilities.
- **Post-exploitation**: Scripts for gathering data and maintaining access after successfully compromising a system.
- **Payloads**: Custom Python payloads for various types of attacks, including reverse shells and command execution.

## Learning Resources

For beginners and experts alike, we provide useful resources to deepen your understanding of offensive security with Python, including:

- Links to online courses and books on Python for security.
- Tutorials and walkthroughs on setting up Python environments for security work.
- Articles and research papers on common vulnerabilities and how Python can be used to exploit them.
